 1. run ./install

* 4. Gallery Setup *

 1. create a configuration for your gallery.
     (you can set a title, stylesheet and photo/thumb directories)
 2. run thumbify (from tools/) to generate thumbnails
 3. run commentify (requires jhead) to set EXIF comments
 4. add gallery name to index.mint

* 5. Misc. *

I believe the parts of the images used are fair use.

- the image 'bg-shade-light.png' is part of the Sky drupal theme and is licenced under the GPL
- the images used in the photo themes are CC-BY-SA (authors: Lisa Tancsics, Mila Zinkova)
- the header image used in the minty theme belongs to the Linuxmint project

* 6. Changelog *
- Fourth Version
 - supports multiple galleries
